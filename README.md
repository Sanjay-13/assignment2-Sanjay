###### Biryani
Biryani is a classic **Indian mixed rice** dish that is part of the **Indian Mughlai culinary tradition**, which traces its roots to central Asian cuisine and a rich fusion with Indian flavors and techniques.I love this dish because **high on flavour** and a **complete meal in itself** and **appeals to every age and every plate**.
